ðŸ§  Red-Black Tree Insertion Fix-Up: All 6 Cases (CLRS)
==========================================================

ðŸ§  Precondition: Inserted node z is RED

The only Red-Black property that can be violated after insertion is:
> No red node can have a red child (i.e. no two reds in a row)

So we fix the tree depending on the structure around z.

==========================================================
ðŸ”´ CASES WHEN z.p IS THE LEFT CHILD OF z.p.p
==========================================================

ðŸ”» Case 1 (Left-Side): Uncle is red
- z.p is red
- z.p.p is black
- Uncle y = z.p.p.right is also red

âž¤ Action:
- Recolor z.p and y (uncle) to black
- Recolor z.p.p to red
- Move z pointer up to z.p.p for further checking

ðŸ”» Case 2 (Left-Side): Uncle is black, and z is right child
- z.p is red
- Uncle y = z.p.p.right is black
- z is right child of z.p (inner case)

âž¤ Action:
- Left-rotate at z.p to make it a "line"
- Now it's Case 3

ðŸ”» Case 3 (Left-Side): Uncle is black, and z is left child
- z.p is red
- Uncle y = z.p.p.right is black
- z is left child of z.p (outer case)

âž¤ Action:
- Recolor z.p to black, z.p.p to red
- Right-rotate at z.p.p

==========================================================
ðŸ”´ CASES WHEN z.p IS THE RIGHT CHILD OF z.p.p
==========================================================

ðŸ”» Case 1 (Right-Side): Uncle is red
- z.p is red
- z.p.p is black
- Uncle y = z.p.p.left is also red

âž¤ Action:
- Recolor z.p and y to black
- Recolor z.p.p to red
- Move z pointer up to z.p.p

ðŸ”» Case 2 (Right-Side): Uncle is black, and z is left child
- z.p is red
- Uncle y = z.p.p.left is black
- z is left child of z.p (inner case)

âž¤ Action:
- Right-rotate at z.p
- Now it's Case 3

ðŸ”» Case 3 (Right-Side): Uncle is black, and z is right child
- z.p is red
- Uncle y = z.p.p.left is black
- z is right child of z.p (outer case)

âž¤ Action:
- Recolor z.p to black, z.p.p to red
- Left-rotate at z.p.p

âœ… Summary Table of All 6 Cases
(without referring to shapes like line/triangle)
==========================================================

| Case | z.p Position | Uncle Color | z Position            | Action                                                             |
|------|--------------|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Left child   | Red         | Doesnâ€™t matter         | Recolor z.p and uncle to black, grandparent to red; move z upward |
| 2    | Left child   | Black       | Right child of z.p     | Left-rotate at z.p; proceed to Case 3                             |
| 3    | Left child   | Black       | Left child of z.p      | Recolor z.p to black, grandparent to red; right-rotate at grandparent |
| 1    | Right child  | Red         | Doesnâ€™t matter         | Recolor z.p and uncle to black, grandparent to red; move z upward |
| 2    | Right child  | Black       | Left child of z.p      | Right-rotate at z.p; proceed to Case 3                            |
| 3    | Right child  | Black       | Right child of z.p     | Recolor z.p to black, grandparent to red; left-rotate at grandparent  |
